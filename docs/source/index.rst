    How to set up I3py and use it.

- :doc:`dev_guide/index`

   You need to add a new instrument to I3py, write some tests, add a simulated 
   instrument, a functionality or simply understand what happens behind the 
   scene you should start here.

- :doc:`faqs/index`

    Some questions that might have occurred to others too.

- :doc:`api_docs/index`

    When all else fails, consult the API docs to find the answer you need.
